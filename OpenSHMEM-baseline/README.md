### Overview
The OpenSHMEM folder contains the `circustent` benchmark, the `OSU_MicroBenchmarks` benchmark, and the source code and script for profiling the OpenSHMEM `get` operation. The `OSU_MicroBenchmarks` benchmark is derived from the original benchmark and only includes OpenSHMEM-related codes. 

### Prerequisites
- **OpenSHMEM Library and Compiler**: Ensure an OpenSHMEM implementation with UCX is installed and accessible. For details: [OpenMPI and OpenSHMEM installation with UCX](https://github.com/openucx/ucx/wiki/OpenMPI-and-OpenSHMEM-installation-with-UCX). 
- **circustent**: Ensure the circustent is installed and accessible. For details: [CircusTent: Atomic Memory Operation System Benchmarks](https://github.com/tactcomplabs/circustent.git).
